# Louis M. Penrod: Portfolio
As a biologist, many of the products I create are propietary in some form or another; class materials belong to the university, data and anlyses prior to publication belong to the PI, data visualizations made for publication belong to the journal, etc. This means much of what I have created, I am not allowed to publicly share, and the parts I am able to share are not publishable on their own. So, I will use this space to showcase what I am allowed to diseminate to those interested; snipets of projects, tools developed, and custom functions.
